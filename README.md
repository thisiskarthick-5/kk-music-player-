## About

The Modern Web Music Player is a frontend-focused project designed to showcase advanced UI/UX design, responsive layouts, and interactive media handling using vanilla web technologies. It features a sidebar playlist, hero section for the currently playing song, animated controls, mobile-friendly interactions, and real-time audio progress tracking.

The project is ideal for demonstrating skills in frontend development, UI animations, JavaScript DOM manipulation, and responsive design without relying on external frameworks.

1. The playlist data is stored as a JavaScript array.
2. Songs are dynamically rendered in the sidebar playlist.
3. Selecting a song loads it into the HTML5 audio player.
4. Playback controls interact with the audio element in real time.
5. Progress bars update automatically as the song plays.
6. Search filters songs by title or artist instantly.
7. Responsive layouts adapt for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
